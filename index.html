  <h2>climber</h2>
  <p> I started cimbing on my tenth birthday and fell in love. Since then I go to every class I can and push myself to try the harder<br>climbs. I've cimbed for three years and feel i'm just starting to get good at it. I hope for this to be a hobby for the rest of my life.<br></p>

  <h2>game dev</h2>
<p>  Ever since i cought a glimps at a game development video, all I can think about Is making one. I have been looking for clubs <br> that'll teach me to code. I want to learn to code so I have time to develop a longterm game. I have many ideas that are <br> long term games, but only a few on games that will help me develop my skills so i can make those games.</p>
